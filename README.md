# Fates-Reprise
Fate's Reprise is another desktop game, and is heavily inspired by the handheld game Link's Awakening. Fate's Reprise is a top-down
game where the player controls a single character named Daur. The goal of the game is to rescue eight gods who are trapped in 
formidable dungeons. Fate's Reprise makes use of fluid combat, puzzle-solving, and interesting dialogue to create an intriguing and deep 
game that users will find both challenging and interesting. By battling with both sword and spells, the game offers a variety of 
ways to tackle enemies and bosses, as well as numerous difficult puzzles.

As a computer game, Fate's Reprise is operated through the keyboard exclusively. The basic movement controls are the WASD scheme. Press F to talk to someone or activate a button/event. Press J, K, or L to use the items in the game. Press Z to go to the pause menu, where the user may equip items using the WASD and JKL keys. Pressing the Z key when a shop windows is open will close it. Additionally, by pressing the secondary button (X) on the pause screen, the user may go to a secondary screen, where the user can view his/her quest items and save/quit the game. Pressing the X button on the normal screen will bring up the map of the overworld/dungeons. 

The game was made through use of the Java engine Libgdx, but still mostly operates upon the principles of Java. The code can be 
looked through and understood with an intermediate understanding of Libgdx and Java.

For anyone wishing to play the game itself, a jar is available for download, which allows any OS to easily launch and run the game. It is located in the Jar Folder in the main folder. Simply double click and play. If for whatever reason this doesn't work, the jar file can be launched via terminal/command line. However, the jar file name must be changed to something without a space and apostrophe before being launched via terminal/command line. 

NOTE: The game is as of yet unfinished. However, the game up until the first dungeon may be completed.
