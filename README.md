# Fates-Reprise
Fate's Reprise is another desktop game, and it is heavily inspired by the handheld game Link's Awakening. Fate's Reprise is a top-down
game where the player controls a single character named Daur. The goal of the game is to rescue eight gods who are trapped in 
formidable dungeons. Fate's Reprise makes use of fluid combat, puzzle-solving, and dialogue to create an interesting and deep 
game that users will find both challenging and interesting. By battling with both sword and spells, the game offers a variety of 
ways to tackle enemies and bosses, as well as numerous difficult puzzles.

As a computer game, Fate's Reprise is operated through the keyboard exclusively, although some of the settings can be changed i
n game. ALl in-game controls are entirely
modifiable, although the default controls use the WASD setup for movement.

The game was made through use of the java engine Libgdx, but still mostly operates upon the principles of java. The code can be 
looked through and understood with at least a basic level of understanding of Libgdx, and an intermediate understanding of java.

For anyone wishing to play the game itself, a jar is available for download, that allows any OS to easily launch and run the game.
